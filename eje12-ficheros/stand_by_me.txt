When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the Moon
Is the only light we'll see

No, I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

So darling, darling, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand, stand by me
Stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains
Should crumble to the sea

I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

And darling, darling, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Woah, stand now
Stand by me, stand by me

Darling, darling, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now
Stand by me, stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble
Won't you stand by me?
Oh, stand by me
Woah, stand now
Oh, stand
